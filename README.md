This app is my first real attempt at making full stack app with a server acting a go between my front and backend. Each of my other apps has been either front end or backend this one has both in it. Its concept is fairly simple. You take a quick test and based on that test we tell you which rock star you are most likely to date. Once you submit your data is put into a new person object and sent via the server to the post route api/add. There using a array of the artists that requiered we compare your scores with each artists scores to we find who you would most likely date and that back a response. The name and picture of said artist is then appeneded into modal which is showen on the screen. 

The server and route creation while fairly new to me where not the hardest part for me. It was getting the model to work which caused me the most headache. Between finding the code to make it appear on the screen to having to tweak the code to make sure it emptied whenever and how ever i closed the modal. Both of which slowed me down a lot. I also had issues with getting the for loops in api route to work the right way. But overall this was fun build. This project was created all by me with help from google and my teachers
